## Backend Developer | Bytecare S.r.l.
_Cagliari, Italy | 2023 ‚Äì 2024_
- Led the implementation of RESTful APIs aimed at the creation of an online app for generating content via AI called Dialogsphere.
- Actively managedall the processes involved in the development and cloud deployment of the aforementioned API.
- Designed an overall service architecture of the whole application starting from the databases up to all the microservices involved.
- Built CI/CD pipelines for Gitlab to automatically push the dockerized app into Google Cloud Platform.
- Implementedseveral Google CloudFunctions in order to have a micro‚Äëservice oriented architecture.
- Maintained the application up to date by constantly adding support to the most recent LLMs and libraries.
- Thankstothisexperience I was able to consolidate my collaborative approach to development.

## University Internship | University of Trento
_Trento, Italy | 2022_
- Fascinated by Cancer research and by howbioinformatics proves useful in that field I developed a R workflow for data analysis.
- The goal of the project was to investigate whether it s possible to contract certain types of cancer due to mutations of a set of genes defined as
 ‚ÄùHumanSpecific‚Äù that were currently being investigated by the University‚Äôs Lab.
- Had the opportunity to interact and query multiple Bioinformatics databases that are still currently used for research.
- Entirely built using R and R studio.
- Supervised by Professor Alessandro Romanel and his equipe.

## University Internship | University of Cagliari
_Cagliari, Italy | 2020_
- Trained, tested and validated various neural networks to distinguish emotions through facial expressions in an E‚ÄëLearning environment.
- Thegoaloftheproject wastodefine the degree of interest of a student while enjoying a given digital content.
- Built a small python demothatcoulddefine thedegreeof emotionapersonwasexperiencing.
- Entirely build using Keras, Tensorflow and Python.
